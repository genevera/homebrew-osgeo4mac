We are currently doing reforms in the tap trying to improve and make it easier to use it. Right now, our main aim is to create a QGIS formula to generate a bottle on the server that will install a complete QGIS version with all the standard plugins, plus some nice additions. All without the need by the end user to build QGIS  in their local machine. 

Not to mention that we are running into some trouble at the moment and we are probably going to make you run in some too. We apologize for all the problems and we hope in the following weeks everything go to normal.
