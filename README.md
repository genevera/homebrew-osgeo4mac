# Homebrew-osgeo4mac

**Build Status**: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac)

This is the [homebrew's][homebrew] tap for the **stable** versions of the [OSGeo][osgeo] geospatial toolset for macOS. We provide up-to-date and easy-to-install formulae for the end user of several projects as [PROJ][proj], [GDAL][gdal] or [PostGIS][postgis]. The tap also includes formulae that may not be specifically from an OSGeo project, but do extend the toolset's functionality.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac` and then `brew install <formula>`. Easy, isn't it? 

You can also install via URL:

```shell
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Docs

Run `brew help`, `man brew`, check the [Homebrew documentation][documentation] or the [tap documentation][osgeo4mac-docs].
